```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

Write a Python code to calculate the sum of all the elements in each row.

Answer:

```python
arr_row_sum = np.sum(arr, axis = 1)
```

### Question 5

Given the following 2D numpy array:

```python
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```
